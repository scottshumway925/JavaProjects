# Flashcard System

This project is a flash card console app that allows the user to create decks of flash cards. The flash card decks can be edited, studied, saved and loaded from another file, or erased from a file.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

- All of the files here are to be built as an executable file.

Instructions for using the software:

1. When you run the software, a console will appear with a menu giving you the different actions the software will be able to produce.
2. By inputting which action you would like to perform, you will be able to create new flash cards that are associated with different decks. These decks can be studied individually, allowing you to view the flash cards and flip them from one side to another. 
3. Currently the project is hard wired to create a new file named 'decks.txt' and save the decks to it when you choose to save. By loading in decks after you've saved them, the system will parse your input and allow you to lead in the previous decks that you've created.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* IntelliJ community IDE. 
* JavaFX, which is a requirement for a WIP feature, hence it is not necessary, but helps to run the features that aren't fully implemented.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* W3Schools
* ChatGPT
* https://openjfx.io/

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I would like to finish working on the graphics portion of this application. Currently, it is hard coded to work in a terminal, but I want this to be a launchable app that students can utilize to study!
* [ ] Second, I will be editing the saving and loading mechanic to allow for the user to save to a file of their choosing. The default will be 'decks.txt', but they will have the option to choose another file to save to.
* [ ] Third, I want to go back and change some of the ways that the code was written. I come from a C# background, so I want to learn the proper way that Java code is written to make this look more like java.
